# SkyCooker Troubleshooting Guide

## Connection Problems

### Error: "No backend with an available connection slot" / "BleakOutOfConnectionSlotsError"

**Cause:** Bluetooth adapter has exhausted the limit of simultaneous connections. This can happen when:
- Other Bluetooth integrations are present (e.g., ha_kettler)
- Too frequent device polling
- Incorrect connection management

**Solution:**
1. **Increase polling interval** in integration settings (recommended 30-60 seconds)
2. **Enable persistent connection** in integration settings
3. **Restart Bluetooth adapter:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
   ```
4. **Restart HomeAssistant**
5. **Check other Bluetooth integrations** - temporarily disable other Bluetooth devices for testing
6. **Ensure device is powered on** and in pairing mode

**For users with multiple Bluetooth devices:**
- **Consider using Bluetooth proxy** (if possible)
- **Increase polling intervals** for all Bluetooth devices (recommended 60+ seconds)
- **Use persistent connections** only for critical devices
- **Temporarily disable other Bluetooth integrations** for testing
- **Restart Bluetooth adapter** when problems occur:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
  ```
- **Check physical device placement** - Bluetooth adapter may not handle multiple devices at distance

### Error: "BleakClient.connect() called without bleak-retry-connector"

**Cause:** Integration cannot use bleak-retry-connector for reliable connection.

**Solution:**
1. **Check dependencies** - ensure bleak-retry-connector is installed:
   ```bash
   pip3 list | grep bleak-retry-connector
   ```
2. **Restart HomeAssistant** to load dependencies
3. **Check manifest.json** - ensure dependency is specified:
   ```json
   "requirements": ["bleak-retry-connector>=1.0.0"]
   ```
4. **If problem persists** - try reinstalling the integration

### Error: "Device with MAC address XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX not found"

**Cause:** HomeAssistant cannot find device by MAC address.

**Solution:**
1. Check device MAC address
2. Ensure device is powered on and within range
3. Check that Bluetooth adapter is working:
   ```bash
   hcitool scan
   ```
4. Restart device and try again

### Error: "Auth failed"

**Cause:** Incorrect authorization key or device not in pairing mode.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure device is in pairing mode (usually indicator blinks)
2. Try default key "000000"
3. If not working, try other variants: "123456", "111111"
4. Restart device and retry

## Control Problems

### Commands not executed

**Cause:** Connection or protocol problems.

**Solution:**
1. Check connection status in HomeAssistant interface
2. Enable persistent connection in integration settings
3. Try restarting integration:
   - Settings → Integrations → SkyCooker → Remove
   - Add integration again

### Incorrect readings

**Cause:** Device doesn't support requested data.

**Solution:**
1. Check that your model is supported
2. Try restarting device
3. Check HomeAssistant logs for errors

## Performance Problems

### Frequent connection drops

**Cause:** Weak Bluetooth signal or interference.

**Solution:**
1. Reduce distance between device and HomeAssistant server
2. Remove obstacles between devices
3. Disable other Bluetooth devices that may cause interference
4. Enable persistent connection in settings

### Slow response

**Cause:** High system load or Bluetooth problems.

**Solution:**
1. Check CPU and memory load on server
2. Increase polling interval in integration settings
3. Restart HomeAssistant

## Bluetooth Check

### Check Bluetooth availability

```bash
# Check Bluetooth status
systemctl status bluetooth

# Scan devices
hcitool scan

# Check adapter
hciconfig -a
```

### Check access rights

```bash
# Check Bluetooth rights
ls -la /dev/ttyACM*

# Add user to Bluetooth group
sudo usermod -a -G bluetooth homeassistant
```

## Logs and Diagnostics

### Enable debug logging

For detailed diagnostics, enable debug logging:

#### Via configuration.yaml
Add to your `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.skycooker: debug
    homeassistant.components.bluetooth: debug
```

#### Via UI (HomeAssistant 2021.6+)
1. Go to Settings → System → Logs
2. Click "Load Full Home Assistant Log"
3. Click "Add Filter"
4. Add filter for `custom_components.skycooker` with level `DEBUG`
5. Click "Start Logging"

### What debug logs show

- **Device connection**: `🔗 Starting connection to cooker`, `✅ Successfully connected`
- **Authentication**: `🔑 Performing authentication`, `✅ Authentication successful`
- **Commands**: `📡 Sending command`, `📥 Received response`
- **Status**: `📊 Requesting device status`, `✅ Status retrieved`
- **Errors**: `❌ Connection failed`, `⚠️ Connection attempt failed`
- **New diagnostic features**:
  - **Raw responses**: `📥 Raw response received: 55 01 06 02 01 1e 5a 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 aa`
  - **Detailed parsing**: `📦 Parsed RMC-M40S status: mode=2, is_on=True, temp=30/90, cook=0:0, wait=0:0, boil_time=0`
  - **Status command**: `📡 Sending command 06, data: []` (command 0x06 for RMC-M40S)
  - **RMC-M40S protocol**: `📦 Detailed byte analysis: data[3]: 1 (hex: 0x01), data[15]: 1 (hex: 0x01)`

### Check HomeAssistant logs

1. Settings → System → Logs
2. Filter: `skycooker`
3. Look for error messages
4. For debug logs use filter: `custom_components.skycooker`
